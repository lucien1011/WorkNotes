Drell-Yan cross section at 13 TeV:

'DYJetsToLL_M50_HT100to200': 194.3,
'DYJetsToLL_M50_HT200to400': 52.24,
'DYJetsToLL_M50_HT400to600': 6.546,
'DYJetsToLL_M50_HT600toInf': 2.179,

~ HT100ToInf: 250pb, ~ 500000 events with 2/fb of data at 13 TeV
As a comparison, 2 /fb of data at 1.96 TeV corresponds to about about 160,000 Z/Drell-Yan.
